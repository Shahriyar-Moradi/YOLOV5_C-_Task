# YOLOV5_OpenCV_Task
In this task, I used the YOLOV5 model to use in  object detection on image.

https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 

First I used pretrained YOLOV5m model then I export it to the ONNX model to use it in OpenCV.After exporting the model run simple object detection with Python and CPP on phone images.
